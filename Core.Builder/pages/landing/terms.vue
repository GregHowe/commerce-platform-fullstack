			<div class="chapter">1. Introduction</div>
			<div class="subchapter">1.1. Our Purpose</div>
			Fusion Marketing Holdings LLC and its affiliates ("Fusion92", "us",
			"our" or "we") offer our Users (as defined below) the ability to
			create and market a custom website on an intuitive and user-friendly
			platform to make managing and promoting their businesses and content
			online easy and stress-free. The customizable online and mobile
			websites and functionalities, and platforms created by Users are
			collectively referred to herein as "User Platform(s)".

			<div class="subchapter">1.2. Legal Agreement</div>
			These Fusion92 Core 2.0 Terms of Use ("Terms of Use"), together with
			such additional terms which specifically apply to some of our
			services and features as presented on the Fusion92 Core 2.0
			website(s) ("Core 2.0 Website", and collectively – the "Core 2.0
			Terms"), set forth the entire terms and conditions applicable to
			you, as a User, and your Authorized Users (as defined below)
			accessing and using the Core 2.0 Website, User Platforms and any
			other services, applications and features offered by us with respect
			thereto, except where we explicitly state otherwise (together with
			the Core 2.0 Website and User Platforms, "Core 2.0 Services" or
			"Services"). For the avoidance of doubt, Services do not include
			services, applications, features, content or components that were
			built, developed, connected or offered by any third parties, even if
			presented on the Core 2.0 Website or made available on your User
			Platform. In addition to these Terms of Use, you acknowledge and
			agree that your access and use of the User Platform is subject to
			your agreement with the specific Fusion92 client to which you are
			affiliated or otherwise in a contractual relationship ("Affiliated
			Client").
			<br /><br />
			By clicking "I accept" below, you signify and affirm your informed
			consent to these Terms of Use and any other Core 2.0 Terms
			applicable to your use of any Core 2.0 Services. If you do not agree
			to the Core 2.0 Terms, you must immediately cease all access and use
			of the Core 2.0 Services.

			<div class="chapter">2. Ownership</div>
			<div class="subchapter">2.1 Ownership</div>
			For each User Platform, Fusion92 will consider the owner of such
			User Platform to be the person or entity listed in Fusion92's
			records as the owner of the User Account or Client User Account
			under for which the User Platform was created. For example, owners
			may be the insurance broker, franchise owner or co-op owner but
			would not be the Authorized Users permitted by such entity to have
			access to the User Platform.
			<br /><br />
			In case of a dispute on User Platform ownership, we reserve the
			right to determine ownership to a User Account or Client User
			Account based on our reasonable judgment, whether or not an
			independent investigation has been conducted by us. However, if we
			cannot make such a determination, as we may deem in our sole
			discretion, we reserve the right to avoid doing so and to suspend a
			User Platform until the parties disputing such ownership reach a
			resolution, without Fusion92 having any liability to you or to any
			other party. We may request documentation (e.g., government-issued
			ID, a business license) that may assist us in determining ownership.

			capacity of your User Platform, including any User Content,
			Authorized User data or other usage data retained therein, and
			including any domain name reservation or registration that was
			included in such Services ("Capacity Loss"). Fusion92 shall not be
			liable in any way for such Capacity Loss, or for saving a backup of
			your User Platform, User Content or Authorized User data. Please
			also note that additional Fees may apply to re-activation of a User
